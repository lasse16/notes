# Font Weights

Font weights are commonly described by either `bold`,`normal`,`thin` with prefixes like `extra` or `semi`.
These are self-explanatory, but in design and styling land, they are often labelled by three-digit numbers.

These numbers range from `900` to `100` with optional steps in-between.
`900` is equivalent to `Extra bold`, while `100` would be `Extra thin`.
Common are:
 - `700`: `bold`
 - `400`: `normal`
 - `300`: `light`
 - `100`: `thin`

Steps that are not in the hundreds, are rare, so rare that I have not seen any yet.
